					<p>ShadowTech Teachers is a programme from TechWomen designed to give<br> Secondary School Teachers and Career Advisors the opportunity to spend half<br> a day with a professional working in the Tech Industry and get an insight into 'a day in the life'!<br> <br>
					Orion is the electricity distributor across Mid-Canterbury and they saw the opportunity to be engaged with ShadowTech Teachers, and were excited to sign up as a host. Orion is always looking for ways to engage with the local community and for the community to engage and understand what they do.<br> They thought that inviting some teachers in might be mutually valuable and that certainly proved to be so.
						Mrs Davey from Lincoln High School<br> and Mrs Kininmonth from Rangiora High School are both digital technology teachers who went along to Orion for the day.<br> Orion employs more than 200 people across a wide range of roles however they focused the time with both the teachers on showcasing roles that would potentially use the type of skills that students in their classes would be learning. </p>

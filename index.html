					<p>Watching you doodle my name in your book is the cutest thing I have ever seen<br>every single thing you do no matter how small makes me smile from your funny jokes<br>
						to your kind and caring words, hearing you laugh and listening to you whine, <br> I love hearing about all the ups and downs of your day and every single little thing that you<br>
						 get excited over. You are my world, you are my princess and I never ever want you to forget that<br> I am always going to be here for you no matter what you maybe going through. I will
						 listen to any <br> cute rant or heavy vent no matter what it's about, because all I care about at the end of the day is <br> making sure that you are feeling the absolute best you can. <br> <br>
						 I had a whole website dedicated to you but everything corrupted at the last minute so I threw this all together as fast as I could, I will spend every waking minute of spare time I have building
						 the best website for you to show off to your friends that I can promise you. I want to give you the world in the palm of your hand, the seas in a glass jar, the moon as your personal nightlight
						 and I will do everything I can to make that happen. Adria, my puppy, my princess, my beautiful angelic doll I care about you more than anything and I hope you have the best birthday ever.

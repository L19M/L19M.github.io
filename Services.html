				<p>ShadowTech Teachers is a programme from TechWomen designed to give Secondary School Teachers and Career Advisors the opportunity to spend half a day with a professional working in the Tech Industry and get an insight into 'a day in the life'!<br><br>
Orion is the electricity distributor across Mid-Canterbury and they saw the opportunity to be engaged with ShadowTech Teachers, and were excited to sign up as a host. Orion is always looking for ways to engage with the local community and for the community to engage and understand what they do. They thought that inviting some teachers in might be mutually valuable and that certainly proved to be so.</p>

				<p>Our Pasifika group has been busy learning and practising sasa. It’s so great to be welcoming new faces, braving the challenge, as well as our fast and enthusiastic learners from Hagley Preschool.<br> We got a surprise when Pale, one of our dads, joined us on the Year 9 Open Night on the pake (drum) and we got a taste of the pace we’ll be at for performance – about three times as fast as we’d been practising!<br> Just as well we’ve got a few months before Polyfest!</p>
